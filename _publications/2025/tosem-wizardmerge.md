    We propose daredevil, a novel kernel storage stack, which addresses the multi-tenancy issue by decoupling the static bindings and allowing full connectivity between cores and NQs. In this way, Daredevil grants multi-tenancy control the flexibility to freely route requests among NQs according to their SLAs. Moreover, it incorporates multi-tenancy-aware scheduling on NQs to facilitate efficient request routing. Our evaluation shows that Daredevil can reduce I/O request latency by up to 3-170Ã— compared to current kernel storage stacks, while maintaining comparable throughput.
